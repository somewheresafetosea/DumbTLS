<span class="doccomment">//! Implementations of various cryptographic ciphers.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The concept of a cipher is likely the most fundamental primitive within</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! cryptography: An algorithm which allows someone (we&#39;ll call them &quot;A&quot;) to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! transform some data (the &quot;plaintext&quot;) to a form that is unreadable to anyone</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! (the &quot;ciphertext&quot;), except a person with some specific knowledge (&quot;B&quot;). This</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! knowledge allows them to transform the ciphertext back into the plaintext</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! from which it was derived.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! When ciphers were first being developed, the knowledge required for B to be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! able to decrypt A&#39;s message was simply the algorithm that the cipher used.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! For example, consider the Caeser Cipher, in which one simply &quot;rotates&quot; each</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! letter of the plaintext 13 places to obtain the ciphertext (so the letter</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &quot;a&quot; becomes &quot;n&quot;, &quot;b&quot; becomes &quot;o&quot;, and so on, with wrapping, so &quot;l&quot; becomes</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &quot;z&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; becomes &quot;a&quot;). The knowledge that &quot;B&quot; needs to have is simply</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! that a Caeser Cipher has been used, and it is then trivial to reverse the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! encryption.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! As time progressed, this approach was challenged. In 1883,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Auguste Kerckhoffs published an article describing desirable properties for</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! military ciphers, one of which was that it should not be a problem if the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! cipher falls into enemy hands. Claude Shannon, now widely considered as the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &quot;father of information theory&quot;, further clarified Kerckhoffs&#39; principle, and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! contributed several other important principles of modern cryptography (which</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! still apply today) in his 1945 report *A Mathematical Theory of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Cryptography*: Ciphers should be designed such that we assume the enemy also</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! knows the design of the system, and they are still secure. It is now the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! norm for new ciphers to be made public, and in general, it is believed that</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! having &quot;more eyes&quot; to look over these algorithms ensures that any security</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! issues are more likely to be found.</span>
<span class="comment">//</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The modern approach to encryption is to add a second input (other than just</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the plaintext) to the cipher: a key. The key changes how the algorithm is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! applied to the input, such that the output of the cipher then depends on</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! both on both the plaintext used and the key. The same key is then necessary</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext. There is one essential</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! property of a cipher which uses keys: Given any number of plaintexts and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! their corresponding ciphertexts, it should not be possible to derive the key</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! that is in use. The intention of such a design is that the algorithm used</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! can be published, and it&#39;s only the key that needs to be kept secret for the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! encryption to be secure.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! When evaluating ciphers, it is necessary to consider how well they obscure</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the relationship between the input and the output: How easy is it to tell</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! what the plaintext was, or gain information about the plaintext, given the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ciphertext? Once again, in *A Mathematic Theory of Cryptography*, Shannon</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! outlined two properties of ciphers which ensure that they successfully</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! conceal this relationship: Confusion and diffusion. Confusion refers to the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! way in which each bit of the ciphertext relates to the key: Each bit of the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ciphertext must depend on multiple parts of the key. This is in contrast to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! a classic one-time-pad, in which bit of the ciphertext corresponds to one</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! bit of the key. Diffusion refers to each bit of the ciphertext depending on</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! multiple parts of the plaintext: If one bit of the plaintext is changed,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! then at least half of the ciphertext should change, on average. These two</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! properties ensure that ciphers are resistant to differential analysis, an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! attack in which multiple similar plaintexts are encrypted, and the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! differences in the resulting ciphertexts are compared.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Types of Cipher</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! We tend to categorise ciphers using either their mode of operation (block or</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! stream), or their usage of keys (symmetric or asymmetric).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Stream ciphers encrypt each bit of the plaintext individually, before moving</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! on to the next bit, and encrypting that. A bit &quot;B&quot; in the plaintext that is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! encrypted after bit &quot;A&quot; cannot affect the resulting output of &quot;A&quot;&#39;s</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! encryption (although the output of &quot;A&quot;&#39;s encryption could affect that of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &quot;B&quot;, if cipher feedback is in use). In block ciphers, on the other hand, the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! plaintext is split into &quot;blocks&quot; of a set size, which are all operated on at</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! once: Each bit of output depends on the content of the entire plaintext</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! block, rather than a single bit of input (and potentially the bits before</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! that). This design feature means that block ciphers are more easily made to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! include diffusion, and it is because of this that the vast majority of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ciphers in use in the real world today operate as block ciphers, rather than</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! stream ciphers.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Symmetric ciphers work using only one key: This is used to encrypt the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! plaintext, then the same key is used to decrypt the resulting ciphertext. In</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! asymmetric ciphers, there are two keys: a public key, and a private key. If</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! one is used to encrypt a message, then only the other can decrypt it. The</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! benefit of this approach is twofold: Firstly, the system can be used to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! encrypt messages intended for a single recipient, by encrypting with the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! public key, such that only the person with the private key can decrypt it,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! like with symmetric encryption. Secondly, a person with a private key can</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &quot;sign&quot; a message by encrypting it with their private key, such that anyone</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! with the public key can decrypt it, and in doing so, verify that it was the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! person with the public key who encrypted it. This allows non-repudiation,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! and identity verification. The drawback to asymmetric encryption is that it</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! often requires considerably larger keys to have the same security as</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! symmetric encryption, and it is difficult to find an effective method of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! key distribution.</span>
