<p>The concept of a cipher is likely the most fundamental primitive within
cryptography: An algorithm which allows someone (we'll call them &quot;A&quot;) to
transform some data (the &quot;plaintext&quot;) to a form that is unreadable to anyone
(the &quot;ciphertext&quot;), except a person with some specific knowledge (&quot;B&quot;). This
knowledge allows them to transform the ciphertext back into the plaintext
from which it was derived.</p>
<p>When ciphers were first being developed, the knowledge required for B to be
able to decrypt A's message was simply the algorithm that the cipher used.
For example, consider the Caeser Cipher, in which one simply &quot;rotates&quot; each
letter of the plaintext 13 places to obtain the ciphertext (so the letter
&quot;a&quot; becomes &quot;n&quot;, &quot;b&quot; becomes &quot;o&quot;, and so on, with wrapping, so &quot;l&quot; becomes
&quot;z&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; becomes &quot;a&quot;). The knowledge that &quot;B&quot; needs to have is simply
that a Caeser Cipher has been used, and it is then trivial to reverse the
encryption.</p>
<p>As time progressed, this approach was challenged. In 1883,
Auguste Kerckhoffs published an article describing desirable properties for
military ciphers, one of which was that it should not be a problem if the
cipher falls into enemy hands. Claude Shannon, now widely considered as the
&quot;father of information theory&quot;, further clarified Kerckhoffs' principle, and
contributed several other important principles of modern cryptography (which
still apply today) in his 1945 report <em>A Mathematical Theory of
Cryptography</em>: Ciphers should be designed such that we assume the enemy also
knows the design of the system, and they are still secure. It is now the
norm for new ciphers to be made public, and in general, it is believed that
having &quot;more eyes&quot; to look over these algorithms ensures that any security
issues are more likely to be found.
The modern approach to encryption is to add a second input (other than just
the plaintext) to the cipher: a key. The key changes how the algorithm is
applied to the input, such that the output of the cipher then depends on
both on both the plaintext used and the key. The same key is then necessary
to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext. There is one essential
property of a cipher which uses keys: Given any number of plaintexts and
their corresponding ciphertexts, it should not be possible to derive the key
that is in use. The intention of such a design is that the algorithm used
can be published, and it's only the key that needs to be kept secret for the
encryption to be secure.</p>
<p>When evaluating ciphers, it is necessary to consider how well they obscure
the relationship between the input and the output: How easy is it to tell
what the plaintext was, or gain information about the plaintext, given the
ciphertext? Once again, in <em>A Mathematic Theory of Cryptography</em>, Shannon
outlined two properties of ciphers which ensure that they successfully
conceal this relationship: Confusion and diffusion. Confusion refers to the
way in which each bit of the ciphertext relates to the key: Each bit of the
ciphertext must depend on multiple parts of the key. This is in contrast to
a classic one-time-pad, in which bit of the ciphertext corresponds to one
bit of the key. Diffusion refers to each bit of the ciphertext depending on
multiple parts of the plaintext: If one bit of the plaintext is changed,
then at least half of the ciphertext should change, on average. These two
properties ensure that ciphers are resistant to differential analysis, an
attack in which multiple similar plaintexts are encrypted, and the
differences in the resulting ciphertexts are compared.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-cipher" class="section-header"><a href="#types-of-cipher">Types of Cipher</a></h1>
<p>We tend to categorise ciphers using either their mode of operation (block or
stream), or their usage of keys (symmetric or asymmetric).</p>
<p>Stream ciphers encrypt each bit of the plaintext individually, before moving
on to the next bit, and encrypting that. A bit &quot;B&quot; in the plaintext that is
encrypted after bit &quot;A&quot; cannot affect the resulting output of &quot;A&quot;'s
encryption (although the output of &quot;A&quot;'s encryption could affect that of
&quot;B&quot;, if cipher feedback is in use). In block ciphers, on the other hand, the
plaintext is split into &quot;blocks&quot; of a set size, which are all operated on at
once: Each bit of output depends on the content of the entire plaintext
block, rather than a single bit of input (and potentially the bits before
that). This design feature means that block ciphers are more easily made to
include diffusion, and it is because of this that the vast majority of
ciphers in use in the real world today operate as block ciphers, rather than
stream ciphers.</p>
<p>Symmetric ciphers work using only one key: This is used to encrypt the
plaintext, then the same key is used to decrypt the resulting ciphertext. In
asymmetric ciphers, there are two keys: a public key, and a private key. If
one is used to encrypt a message, then only the other can decrypt it. The
benefit of this approach is twofold: Firstly, the system can be used to
encrypt messages intended for a single recipient, by encrypting with the
public key, such that only the person with the private key can decrypt it,
like with symmetric encryption. Secondly, a person with a private key can
&quot;sign&quot; a message by encrypting it with their private key, such that anyone
with the public key can decrypt it, and in doing so, verify that it was the
person with the public key who encrypted it. This allows non-repudiation,
and identity verification. The drawback to asymmetric encryption is that it
often requires considerably larger keys to have the same security as
symmetric encryption, and it is difficult to find an effective method of
key distribution.</p>
